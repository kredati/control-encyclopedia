# The Encyclopedia of Control
The collective final project for Scott Richmond's CIN360H1-S17: Media, Technology, Control course, at the University of Toronto in Spring 2017.

The Encyclopedia is presented as a guide to undergraduate students and other researchers interested in the work of Michel Foucault and the contemporary politics of digital media. Not all the articles do the same thing: some are carefully explanatory; some work out a concept in relation to a case study; others track the history of a concept.

The Encyclopedia lives in [the Wiki](https://github.com/kredati/control-encyclopedia/wiki) of this GitHub repository, free for the world to see.

For any questions, you can contact Professor Scott Richmond at s.richmond {at} utoronto {dot} ca.
